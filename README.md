# From Zero to _n_ (grams): A Very Basic Bootcamp for Text Analysis in Python

In this informal bootcamp, intended for folks with no coding or command line experience, I will walk through the process of designing a very basic python script that you can use to query a textual corpus. I will cover software installation, basic interaction on the command line, basic Python syntax and constructs, and show how to put together a script to do some simple text analyses. We also discuss some of the nuances involved in doing text analysis in languages other than English. You will hopefully leave with a basic understanding of Python that will lead you to more advanced analysis and creativity in the future!

If you are a William & Mary student interested in doing research in my digital humanities lab, this is an excellent opportunity to jump start with the knowledge you will need to be an active participant in the lab!
