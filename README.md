# From Zero to _n_ (grams): A Very Basic Bootcamp for Text Analysis in Python

In this informal bootcamp, intended for folks with no coding or command line experience, I will walk through the process of designing a very basic python script that you can use to query a textual corpus. I will cover software installation, basic interaction on the command line, basic Python syntax and constructs, and show how to put together a script to do some simple text analyses. We also discuss some of the nuances involved in doing text analysis in languages other than English. You will hopefully leave with a basic understanding of Python that will lead you to more advanced analysis and creativity in the future!
